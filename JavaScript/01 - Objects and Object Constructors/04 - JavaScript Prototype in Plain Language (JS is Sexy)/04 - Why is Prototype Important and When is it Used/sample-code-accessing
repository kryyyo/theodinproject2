let myFriends = {name: "Pete"};

// To find the name property below,
// the search will begin directly on the myFriends object
// and will immediately find the name property because
// we defined the property name on the myFriend object.
// This could be thought of as a prototype chain with one link.
console.log(myFriends.name);

// In this example, the search for the toString () method will also begin on the myFriends’ object,
// but because we never created a toString method on the myFriends object,
// the compiler will then search for it on the myFriends prototype (the object which it inherited its properties from).

// And since all objects created with the object literal inherits from Object.prototype,
// the toString method will be found on Object.prototype—see important note
// below for all properties inherited from Object.prototype. 
myFriends.toString ();
